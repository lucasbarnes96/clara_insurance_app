# Clara Insurance: Investment Thesis & Strategic Plan

**To:** Investment Committee, Portage Ventures  
**From:** The Founders, Clara Insurance  
**Date:** July 7, 2025  
**Subject:** Seed Investment in an AI-Native Insurance Brokerage for the Agent Economy

---

## 1. Executive Summary: A New Philosophy for Insurance

Clara is an AI-native insurance brokerage built for the emerging AI agent-to-agent economy. We reject "growth at all costs" in favor of disciplined risk avoidance using the 80/20 principle:
- **Serve the top 80%** of responsible insurance clients.
- **Avoid the bottom 20%** of high-risk profiles.

Our proprietary **Risk Filter** uses AI to qualify only the highest-quality applicants for carrier partners, who set final pricing. By excluding the most complex risks, we:
- Reduce claim frequency and severity.
- Invest in a superior AI-powered claims and service experience.
- Target a **50% operating margin** (vs. ~27% industry benchmark), enabling flexibility to maximize profitability or customer value.

## 2. Market Positioning: The Profitability Quadrant

| Model                             | Primary Goal            | Risk Approach                                                      | Core Weakness                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Direct Insurers**               | Market Share            | Price every risk; invest in predictive data (e.g., telematics).     | Must underwrite full risk spectrum → frequent, complex claims; high R&D cost.   |
| *Lemonade, Geico*                 |                         |                                                                     |                                                                                  |
| **Traditional Brokers**           | Volume / Placement      | Risk-agnostic; pass all applicants to carriers.                     | High staff costs (50%+ revenue) → low margins and disjointed CX.                 |
| *Incumbents*                      |                         |                                                                     |                                                                                  |
| **Clara (AI-Native Broker)**      | Quality & Profitability | 80/20 filter eliminates bottom 20% of risks; carriers handle pricing.| Smaller TAM by design; focused on high-quality segment.                         |

### Highway Strategy

Analogous to Tesla, we master the "highway of insurance"—the top 80% of clean, low-risk profiles—rather than navigating the chaotic "urban driving" of all risks. This focus enables effective automation, trust-building, and superior efficiency.

### Pillar B: AI-Powered Service & Operations
- **Radical Cost Efficiency:** Lean licensed broker team + AI → reduce staff costs from ~51% to 30% of revenue.
- **AI Claims Concierge:** Hands-on, AI-assisted service enabled by low claim volume.
- **Proactive Engagement:** Automated reminders and risk mitigation tips.

### Pillar C: Future-Proof Technology Stack
- **Pragmatic Quoting:** Third-party rating platforms (Applied WebRater, TurboRater) for compliance and connectivity.
- **Seamless Financial Ops:** Integrations with VoPay and FIRST Insurance Funding for payments and financing.
